A look into the future of banking, Aspiration

Aspiration Financial, LLC is a nonbank financial institution that offers most, if not all, of the benefits of a traditional bank with minimal drawbacks – Maybe except for being unable to deposit cash. Aspiration, incorporated in 2013 and opened in 2015 by Andrei Cherny and Joseph Sanberg, offers consumers fatigued by the pain points of traditional banks the chance to patronize a more socially conscious, “Do Well, Do Good” financial institution. "Aspiration is a financial firm for everyone that is built on the idea that profits and purpose can go hand-in-hand," said Andrei Cherny, CEO, and co-founder of Aspiration. Aspiration finished its Series A funding on September 17th, 2015, with a total of $15.5 million – Big players in the funding sprint were GSV Capital, Capricorn Investment Group, IGSB, along other top American finance and technology investors. 

Aspiration’s business model is to provide people with a more socially conscious banking solution to the traditional brick and mortar experience. Although traditional banks ensure your money all of the time, not just over night, and allow for depositing of cash, a fully online bank offers many perks. Especially when considering ALL of the additional perks you get with opening an Aspiration account. It would seem as though this is the millennial’s bank, but really it is just a future proof virtual bank. From $0 monthly fees to free ATM usage, Aspiration has many great perks that traditional banks can’t afford to have. The business benefits of having a mostly virtual overhead allows for revenue to be allocated elsewhere, or in Aspiration’s case, this surplus shows itself in the low – no fees. Owning an account with Aspiration you can save more by earning interest on your savings and cash back for spending with companies deemed socially responsible. Another great thing about owning an account is that you know that every year 10% of Aspiration’s customer fees are donated to charity. 

Aspiration offers some investment opportunities to all of its customers in the form of The Aspiration Redwood Fund. This is one of the earliest of its kind, a sustainable investment fund or ESG (environmental, social, and governance). ESG refers to a set of standards for a company’s behavior used by socially conscious investors to screen potential investments. The Redwood Fund is backed by the investment arm of UBS Asset Management. The fund invests specifically in equity securities, which include, but are not limited to, dividend-paying securities, common stock, preferred stock, shares of investment companies, convertible securities, warrants and rights. 

Aspiration is in the “Personal Finance/ Deposits/ Online Banking” domain of the financial services industry. All of the major trends and innovations of this domain have been invented in the past 10 years. Before that, there was little to no online banking access except as an extension of a traditional bank’s online applications. Other online banking companies are Chime, Current, and Axos bank – All offering similar low cost, free ATM, interest on savings, accounts. 

In conclusion, Aspiration is a disruptive fintech company looking to do good in the world through the ESG model and by making sure profits go to the users and charities. I suggest the company figure out how to deal with cash, not sure if that means a strategic partnership with a big bank, or some proprietary machine for collecting funds and storing them, but the first online bank that can figure this out will have a hold on the market. It may be the case that this is just not possible with an online bank, and the only solution is to have a traditional bank to deal with cash. Either way Aspiration offers many great perks that I think everyone should explore.
